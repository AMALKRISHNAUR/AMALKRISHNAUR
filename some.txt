/* Box model of css every thing in the web is a box
id a div have 600px and 300px width then i can change this if change this
the nigboring is push away from the div box box have a border it has length solid has 3px value
the blue area not change by changing border we spacify padding to give a space between border and content
we can add margin its a buffer zone between corent element and other element it give little space between elements
 block elements block other not to enter in the same line with inline element you can't change width and height but you can change in block elements
 you can change display property to inline and other types
 in inline you can't change width and height if you want to be inline and block at same time yopu have inline-block
 here you can change width and height and it acts as inline choose images as inline elements
 none get ride of the element when display:none
 visibility:hidden
 it disappears actualy that eleemnts are there */

/* Now we talk about css positioning
in html you can do that also content is everything  */

2.order comes From code
you write the order in html you choose that
3. Children sits on parent
<div>
<h1>jdfjdj</h1>
</div>
h1 sits on div so you can see that elements

position
++++++++
static
all html is static in default
without changing position
Relative

in this case we provide relative postion to original position
it pushs to some pixels the aounds from its previous position
doing this others not move so if if we nove somnetime it sits on some other elements
moving relative to where the image use to be

apsalute positioning
++++++++++++++++++++
if you want position this way then you need to a parent other then body then you need to set it relative
Absalute positioning is positio relative to parents in most case it will div or body tags
right:30px; means it move 30px to left by 30px from the most rigt corner
fixed
+++++
if you used this it fixed there when scrolling it not move it stay there it usefull for nave and side bar
text-align
not work for block with width
+++++++++
work only on inline block or full width block element use oly parent continer
auto centers
for horzonytal margin top right bottom left 0 auto 0 auto

rem ignores parents fontsize


clear is used to not to float some parent
ex)
float:left;
clear:left;
then it cancels out
only use float to wrap around the text not use for positioning
