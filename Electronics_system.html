        Here I am going to explain about electronics. Mathematics is a tool to decribe the physical world by building models. Any mathematical model is valid as long as it is self consistent but in physics it must meet the experiments.
        What are the equation that describe electrical behaviour? It is maxwell's equation right. Before that we need to understand the maths such as the divergents and curl. 
        Below is the equations that describe electrical systems.
    </p>
    <p>
            \[ \vec{\nabla} \cdot\ \vec{D} = \rho \]
            \[ \vec{\nabla} \cdot\ \vec{B} = 0 \]
            \[ \vec{\nabla} \times\ \vec{E} + \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} = 0 \]
            \[ \vec{\nabla} \times\ \vec{H} - \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t} = \vec{J} \]
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        These are Maxwell's equations that discribe the electrical systems. All of the above equations are associated with vector field.
        the divergents tell us how much a point bleeds out. The forml defenition is 
      \[\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \lim_{A \to 0} \frac {\oint_{S} F \cdot \vec{dr}}{A}\]
      We calculate how much it fluid out througha closed loop s then we divide by Area to normalise in the limiting case it become a properties of a point

      Thes equations are very complex and calculating a simple circuit with these take so much time. Also it very hard to do. So we only do these for some special cases. First one is 
      the dimension of the circuit much less than the wave length of intrest. ie \(D<<\lambda\). This means the propagation occure instently. So there is no delay. In this we can assume the speed of light is \(\infty\).
      In this case The equation can reduced to.
       \[\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} = \mu_{0} j + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \]
       if we assume \(c\to\infty\) then this become
       \[\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} = \mu_{0} j\]
       Taking div in both side give
       \[\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} =\vec{\nabla} \cdot \mu_{0} j\]
       the divergence of curl is zero so the euation become
       \[\vec{\nabla} \cdot j = 0\]
       This means there is no accumilation of charge. The other case is treating charge as continuous value rather then discrete. In this we don't look at individual electrons. 
       It like an hydrology analagy because in that we don't think of single water molecules that same applay to electonics also.
